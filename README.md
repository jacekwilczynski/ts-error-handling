# Error handling demo
Just a small experiment in several approaches at async error handling.

## Requirements
Node.js. I used v16.17.1, but any recent one should work.

## Setup
```shell
yarn install
```

## Launching
```shell
yarn <example_number> # (see the src directory for the examples)
```
e.g.
```shell
yarn 2
```
